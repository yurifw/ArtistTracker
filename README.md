You input a folder, a city and state and a distance radius, the software will scan your folder searching for upcoming concerts of the found artists within the specified radius of your city and state. This search is made using the [Band Is In Town api](http://www.bandsintown.com/)

The given folder should contain the name of the artists, for example:
